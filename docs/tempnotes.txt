- piping:
    - closing write end at end of parent and closing write end are DIFFERENT OPERATIONS, don't mix this up
        - without parent closing, read() might block indefinitely 
        - child closes its own copy of the write endpoint because it doesn't need to write to the pipe 

- for kyle:
    - reviewed lab to make sense of everything, feel alls clear now 
    - fixed some error handling in pipes.c and kash.c, might have not covered it all, though 
    - started working on implementation of get and run job functions 
        - think we needed to fix tokenizer to handle different delimiters and I think this should fix it
        - need to interate through buffer of the tokens and handle different delimiters in different ways, shouldn't be too bad 
        - got up to this point and started fading out, going to return to this tomorrow unless I get a second wind 
    - tried to document what it seems next steps are, don't take it as gospel but I think it's covers most stuff haha 
    - having weird exiting issue, trying to debug it before moving forward 
        - FOUND IT, good god that took a while 

- TODO (ordered list):
    - current stage:
        - need to fix string tokenizer to split by delimiters 
        - finish implementing get_job
            - splits based on |, >, <, & and adds to job attributes, handling different actions these operators do 
        - finish implementing run_job
            - handle redirection 
            - add 2-stage piping support and background support 
    - final stage:
        - B Mark Range:
            - split up into .c and .h files as necessary  
            - n-stage pipelines 
            - would probably be a good idea to replace syscalls with wrappers that handle error handling; easy to do with >replace in search menu 
        - B+ Mark Range:
            - implement command search paths 
        - A- Mark Range: 
            - additional enhancements, up to and including some basic signal handling 

- TODO (unordered list):
    - catch up on documentation 
    - organize structs, functions, etc into seperate .c and .h files 
    - determine if p_foo style makes sense, decide to keep it or nix it
