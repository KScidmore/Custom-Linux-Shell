- Pointers:
    - naming:
        - the pointer name begins with the letter p to distinguish it 
    - declaration:
        - note that these are all the same:
            - int* pBar
            - int * pBar 
            - int *pBar 
        - an asterisk must be in front of each pointer 
            - int* p1, p2 does not declare 2 pointers 
            - int *p1, *p2 declares 2 pointers 
        - for these reasons, I think we should go with this convention:
            - int *pBar 

- Indentation Style:
    - decided on One True Brace style (like K&R but excludes single-statement code blocks)
    - e.g.
        while (x ==y ) {
            if (error) {
                fix_error();
            } else {
                foo();
                bar();
            }
        }

- Naming Variables:
    - camelCase

- Misc:
    - lines must not exceed 80 characters 
    - no magic numbers 

- one blank space between operators (excluding arrow operator to access members of structs):
    - e.g. 
        5 + 3 = 7
    - exception:
        p->member 
- use parenthesis for clarity with order of operations 
- access members of a structure with p->member rather than (*p).member 

- Code Organization:
    #include <>
    #include ""
    #defines
    Data Types (e.g., structures)
    Globals
    Prototypes
    Code (w/ main function first)


- Interesting Ideas / Stuff to Discuss:
    - global variables should be avoided, but when used, prepend them with a g?
    - adding comments to closing braces:
        - helps when lots of nesting or lots going on 
        - don't have to find the starting brace to know whats going on then 
        - can help when else statements are sort of offset from the closing bracket of the if or elseif 
        - e.g.
            while(1) {
                if (valid) {
                    //somecode 
                } /* if valid */
                else {
                } /* not valid */
                
                } /* end forever */
