1. Project Governance
==========
- overall:
    - want to complete project 
    - targeting an A- 
    - responsible for regular communication and efforts towards the project 
- policy: 
    - meet roughly weekly, communicate every 1-2 days, conduct ourselves as we did during 2659 
    - 2 partners so we split work equal 
    - will spend time during reading break as needed, but aiming for initial deadline 
    - group issues, tensions, conflict will be resolved through respectful discussion and we will propose our personal arguments for/against features etc 
    - code and documentation standards slightly modified from past classes and some personal work we've done 
    - no team lead, both equal partners 


2. Project Management
==========
- planning:
    - planning to meet initial deadline 
    - trying to follow project guidance to meet weekly targets, but leaving ourselves a bit of leeway 
    - using text and discord to communicate, github for version control 
- group decisions about high-level design architecture: 
    - 2 yes, 1 no for all decisions 
- allocation of resources: 
    - will be decided upon together on a weekly basis, aiming to meet equal labour, with consideration towards one anothers courseload 
- integration and review: 
    - regular code reviews 

 
3. Project Labour 
==========
- the workload is divided and both members are meant to complete their share to the best of their ability
- at this point, we will come together to finish things up 
- once complete, we will do a full code review to understand the entire solution/connection to course concepts 
- will both document things as needed to contribute to presentation 
- group-support will in general mean clear and regular communication on all matters
